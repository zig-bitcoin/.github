# Zig Bitcoin Community

Welcome to the Zig Bitcoin community! We're a group of developers passionate about implementing Bitcoin protocols and tools using the Zig programming language. Our goal is to create robust, efficient, and educational Bitcoin software that leverages Zig's unique features.

## Why Zig for Bitcoin?

Zig offers several advantages for Bitcoin development:

- **Reasonable Safety with Performance**: Zig provides compile-time safety without sacrificing runtime performance, crucial for Bitcoin applications.
- **Simplicity**: Zig's "only one obvious way to do things" philosophy aligns well with Bitcoin's need for clear, auditable code.
- **Low-level Control**: Zig allows fine-grained control over memory and system resources, essential for optimizing Bitcoin software.
- **Cross-compilation**: Easily compile Bitcoin tools for various platforms without complex setups.
- **Clear Error Handling**: Zig's error handling model helps create more robust Bitcoin software.

## Our Projects

We're actively developing several Bitcoin-related projects in Zig:

1. [bitcoin-zig](https://github.com/zig-bitcoin/bitcoin-zig): Core Bitcoin primitives implemented in Zig, including base58, bech32, and more.

2. [btczee](https://github.com/zig-bitcoin/btczee): A full Bitcoin protocol implementation in Zig, including a node, wallet, and miner.

3. [coconut](https://github.com/zig-bitcoin/coconut): A Cashu wallet and mint implementation in Zig, exploring Bitcoin-based digital cash protocols.

4. [libsecp256k1-zig](https://github.com/zig-bitcoin/libsecp256k1-zig): Zig bindings for the libsecp256k1 library, essential for Bitcoin cryptography.
